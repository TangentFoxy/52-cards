# 52 Cards

Does what it says on the tin (including little notes at the bottom on how to use it!).

The only thing it won't tell you how to do is press M to generate a new deck (clipped in the top left corner). This is because that's not really intended, and this is a brand new super alpha project thing. (Oh, and press J to get 2 Jokers.)
